mats need to be repopulated along the lines DK had originally organized it, but many of the containers it previously held were too bulky to share by means of git. 

controls has the heirarchy established for the UI to a certain degree, but needs definition based on run of show. Input from dedicated midi controler(s) tbd and will take up much of the work. UI will be used to outline button functionality and A/B deck visualizers. AbletonIn and AudioAnalyze chops will live here, as will a rider tracker UV/XY panel and trigger buttons for different texture 3d/cache looks.

objects will need a couple more render options and methods of outputing different .fbx or alembic scenes. Move the instance scenes here from mats.

output has been optimized for 1280 x 720 projectors. The UI will also be selected into a container here for performance mode.
